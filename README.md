# nyc-public-schools
an analysis on nyc public schools

#for my project I will select High Schools in the boro of Brooklyn (aka Kings County) 
#and list out the top 5 schools in terms of % of students passing the regents in the year 2017 for Common Core Algebra
#i did my initial school last as my HS was closed in 2014 and made into 7 seperate schools on the campus, so i selected one of the top 5 from results
